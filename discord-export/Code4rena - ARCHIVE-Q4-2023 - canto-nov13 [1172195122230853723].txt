If you think you can find an issue in OZ you can hit a big bug bounty ngl XDD

Can anyone help me to find the part of initializing admin address in cer20 token?
As you know, require(msg.sender ==  admin) is in initialize function but there is no function that sets admin address like as constructor


[11/15/2023 05:00] nmirchev8
It uses  `Ownable()` constructor, which sets the admin to msg.sender

Could you provide some explanation to the ``getPriceAndFee()`` parameters. At first look I cannot wrap my head around why we skip the totalCount index by adding 1 and why during sale we do ``-amount + 1``

@Roman How can I see the turnstile contract code?


[11/15/2023 08:31] nmirchev8
`shareCount The number of shares in circulation. For buys, this is the amount after the first buy succeeds (e.g., 1 for the first ever buy).
    /// For sells, this is the amount before the sell is executed (e.g., 1 when the only remaining share is sold).`

If this is helpful. I think after reading it 2-3 times and the example in the test I have understood


[11/15/2023 09:13] lambda9382
Should not be very relevant for this contest, but if you are interested in the details, there was a previous contest for the turnstile contracts: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-canto/tree/main

why are assigning turnstile to asD's, isn't it meant to be used with nft's ?


[11/15/2023 10:34] plamkata
Do we ever make sure that the cNote provided is the correct token


[11/15/2023 12:14] nmirchev8
Deployer of the factory is trusted and there it is set as immutable... I guess this makes it safe


[11/15/2023 13:15] chainsnake
@Roman , is there any doc to easily understand market fee calculation logic?


[11/15/2023 13:22] nmirchev8
What is the case if there are active shares with a bonding curve, which later would be removed


[11/15/2023 13:25] lambda9382
No, but for `LinearBondingCurve`, the formula is pretty simple. It is `0.1 / log2(shareCount)`. The intuition behind this is that the fee should decrease for larger markets (hence the division by the share count), but it should only do so slowly / sub-linear (hence the log2)

[11/15/2023 14:05] lambda9382
You mean the `turnstile.register` in the constructor? That is related to CSR (https://docs.canto.io/evm-development/contract-secured-revenue) and ensures that we get the CSR revenue, but not connected to the functionality of the protocol

I dont get in the tests why the Market contract mint all the ASD ( here MTK) tokens then how people are able to use buy()


[11/15/2023 14:21] 0xauditism
@Roman  But I don't see why it is needed in the asDFactory and asD, isn't the CSR only relevant for NFT's ?


[11/15/2023 14:22] lambda9382
No, you can register CSR for every contract (on Canto). You get an NFT in return (which allows you to claim the revenue), but otherwise, CSR and NFTs are not connected

@Roman what's the reason that a holder cannot claim the fee of `buy()`?


[11/16/2023 13:13] lambda9382
You mean why they do not profit from the fees of their own buys? Mainly a design decision, but would also lead to weird incentives (making it profitable to split up a large buy into many smaller ones)

quick question @Roman . Are there market contracts for every aSD?


[11/16/2023 17:58] lambda9382
No, there probably will not be a 1:1 mapping between markets and asD tokens. One asD tokens can have none associated markets or it could also have multiple ones (although that is rather unusual)

[11/17/2023 03:59] nailkhalimov
Based on documentation: `1155tech is an art protocol that will use asD as its currency. In contrast to existing bonding curve protocols, users can pay a fee to mint ERC1155 tokens based on their shares.`
It means on amount of shares is calculating fees for minting ERC1155 tokens.

During the audit, I recommend not looking at the bot report and looking for vulnerabilities yourself, and only after finding it, check before submission whether it is in the bot report to avoid duplication.

If the situation repeats itself and your finds are found automatically, it is not worth spending your time on them. Try to automate them. üòâ

thats an interesting approach. that is definitely a good approach to learning a lot of things and building a good foundation. I like how it incorporates making your own tools


[11/17/2023 14:32] thekmj
I think reading the bot report (especially L issues) is still really good for learning as a dev. In a real world setting, a lot of "best practices" can be extended to an actual vulnerability. With a bot that nitpicks all of your smallest issues, you can hardly overlook anything, and you get up-to-date with the tech as well.

Anyone have a backstage role? I would like to see feedback on my issue as I am sure it was a valid thing, same with analysis.


[12/05/2023 21:37] itsmetechjay
You'll be able to see the results of your findings once the report is published and the findings repo is public.


[12/05/2023 21:38] kimchi_the_dog
Is the repo with the finds already available? What is the link?


[12/05/2023 21:38] itsmetechjay
It is not available yet - once we publish the report it will be made available.


[12/05/2023 21:39] kimchi_the_dog
Ok, that's why I wanted someone with a backstage role. Unfortunately, usually we have to wait a very long time for the report. : (


[12/05/2023 21:40] kimchi_the_dog
Thank you for your replies @Jay | C4


[12/05/2023 21:49] itsmetechjay
Yep I can understand wanting to see your results sooner.  Backstage wardens also need to keep the information about findings private until the repos are open.

[12/10/2023 04:36] chris0xff
if my finding is not on the list that means i can disclose it in public?


[12/10/2023 08:36] kimchi_the_dog
Overall, it's probably recommended to wait.

But there's really no prohibition I believe. The finding has been declared invalid and you will not be able to escalate it anyway as it requires a backstage role.


[12/10/2023 08:43] chris0xff
k why was it invalid?


[12/10/2023 08:49] kimchi_the_dog
I don't know, we'll only find out when the report comes out. (I also don't have a backstage role), but if you say it's not on the list, it certainly wasn't considered valid.


[12/10/2023 08:49] kimchi_the_dog
(I have a similar case, I also believe that what I reported was valid) - so I understand and wait with you bro üòÑ


[12/10/2023 08:51] chris0xff
wait for what though?


[12/10/2023 08:53] kimchi_the_dog
to see why it was marked invalid


[12/10/2023 08:54] chris0xff
mmm yes. but if you are sure that it is technically valid then what could be helpful there


[12/10/2023 09:00] chris0xff
it owuld have to be marked invalid for some reason about scope or something or perceived lack of impact within the context of the codebase in scope, or something like that, which is not relevant to the quality of your work, so its not really useful to learn from in a technical sense.


[12/10/2023 09:02] chris0xff
or if it was erroneusly marked invalid it owuldnt matter because there is no way to correct that


[12/10/2023 09:05] chris0xff
am i correct here? theres no action that can be taken if you dont have backstage access. so theres nothing to wait for other than technical feedback that protentially exists in the report repo


[12/10/2023 18:06] catscanaudit
If you are 100% sure it's a valid bug and in-scope and provided working coded PoC to prove it's a bug it would be valid


[12/10/2023 18:09] catscanaudit
I'm not sure if you need backstage to escalate findings but I believe so


[12/10/2023 18:09] catscanaudit
Yeah you need it cause you cant see the judging repo without backstage


[12/10/2023 18:09] chris0xff
im 100% sure its a valid bug but in the context of the codebase it could be argued to be of dubious impact


[12/10/2023 18:10] catscanaudit
Sorry Im just a warden cant help further


[12/11/2023 02:14] wangxx2026
It may be an issue, but it also depends on the impact of the issue. Some issues with minor impacts will not be taken seriously. Some projects will issue issue bounties on other platforms. You can pay attention to whether this project will issue issue bounties later. If so, you can submit more sufficient evidence to submit the issue again.


[12/11/2023 11:40] chris0xff
bugs only decay in value generally. it was not hard to find, had signs of a struggle followed by a big blood trail right up to the mangled corpse

Hey guys, how can I take a look at submitted issues/escalate if I am not backstage?


[12/15/2023 14:00] _paperparachute
When the sponsor is ready, the repo will be made public, and you can check your findings then.


[12/15/2023 14:12] anarcheuz
I see rewards have already been attributed to some people. Does it mean my submissions were not valid if I don't see them? If yes it's not possible to escalate or at least know why it's invalid since repo is not public until the sponsor is ready?


[12/15/2023 14:13] _paperparachute
Yes, if you weren't in the award announcement you can assume your findings were invalidated. You won't be able to see why until the repo is public.


[12/15/2023 14:15] anarcheuz
Is it possible to argue if it was erroneously deemed invalid when the repo is public ?


[12/15/2023 14:19] _paperparachute
Please see [this](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/fairness-and-validity#if-you-disagree-with-a-judges-decision) section of the docs.


[12/15/2023 14:20] anarcheuz

[12/16/2023 18:41] sivanesh_808
Rewards are sent ??


[12/16/2023 19:27] 0xaadhi
Yes


[12/17/2023 08:28] kimchi_the_dog
Hey @0xTheC0der , could you please explain why this issue was marked as duplicate and out of scope?
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto-findings/issues/51

There is a significant difference in:
1. results/impact on risk
2. way on how to remove the vulnerability (this issue can be removed while leaving renounce not overridden, if the team wants to keep this feature).


[12/17/2023 17:39] 0xthec0der
Hey,
renouncing the ownership and possibe implications are already covered by L-11 in the  bot report and therefore OOS , see https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto/blob/main/bot-report.md#L-11

Furthermore, this would be owner self-harm which is only of low severity.


[12/17/2023 18:30] kimchi_the_dog
But this issue is not that it can be renounced. It is associated with CSR rewards. The vulnerability can be removed by using the `assign()` function instead of `register()` from trunstile and assigning CSR rewards to a previously created NFT.

And it wouldn't be self-harm because it requires awareness of what a given function will do. In this case, the expected action after "renounce" is to no longer have the owner. However, this bug is besides not having an owner also blocks forever an important part of the project and is irreversible.


[12/17/2023 19:29] 0xthec0der
Issue could only arise after renouncing ownership of factory (malicious owner action) --> OOS L-11.

If it would not be OOS:
Factory itself is "worthless" since it holds no assets and can be easily redeployed.
No rewards or user funds are lost.
Due to low impacts and requiring owner error --> Overinflated severity


[12/18/2023 07:06] kimchi_the_dog
Okay, although I don't agree with the first point (because renounce is not a malicious function in itself - if it were, it wouldn't be in the standard. You may want to call it simply to get rid of ownership, and the fact is that it will crash part of the project is a bug that does not result from self-harm.

In the second case, if we assume that we do not mind redirecting users to a new address (which is not easy without a proxy), I understand your point of view.

Thanks for explanation your point of view.
